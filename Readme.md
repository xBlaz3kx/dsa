# Data structures and algorithm implementations in Go

In this repository, I will be implementing various data structures and algorithms in Go. This is a work in progress and
I will be adding more implementations as I go along.

All the implementations are tested using unit tests. You can find the tests in the `*_test.go` files. You can run the
tests using the `go test -v ./...` command.
